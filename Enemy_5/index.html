<ul>



<li><strong>Updates:</strong>
This game is a iteration of a previous game.
This game now has different levels and the characters are more polished.
Also it has more features like a metal level 2 to make it harder to get a high score.

</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme used for this game is revenge.
</li>

The input is the keyboard, there is some randomness to this in terms of how the other player moves up and down.
The play style is achiever you are trying to achieve an objective.
</li>

The player should be able to press the keys fast on the keyboard and be able to move fast, so that they can dodge the bullets and be able to fire back.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move around the map using the arrow keys on the keyboard. They can fire using the spacebar.
The other player moves randomly up and down while firing the bullets, the player has to move fast to dodge the bullets and fire back.
To help the player, the player’s bullets are faster than the other player’s bullets. And there is a sound effect.
Also the other player’s bullets are at a constant rate, while the player’s fire rate depends on how the player fires rather than a set order.
If this was not the prototype there would have been obstacles in the way to block the bullets and this will make it harder for the player to win the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype is evaluating moving with the keys and being able to detect who has won depending on the gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player has control of a character and is able to move around the map not just left or right.
Also the way the other player moves is unique because it is at random.
Also it has cool sound effects when the player fires.

The setting takes place in the future when AI and humans are considered the same.
The good guy is the player and his name is Jack and the bad guy is a computer generated robot made to look like a human and it name is Rust.
Once Jack and Rust used to be best friends and they work for an agency with specializes in extraction of high value people from threats.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
On one of there operations, Rust being the AI was able to make a good plan for extraction, so Jack and Rust went with the plan, but plan got the high value person killed.
For many reasons, Jack had to take the blame. In the game, it is the current time and Jack is trying to get revenge by trying to kill Rust.
