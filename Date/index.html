<h2>Compatibility of the date</h2>
<ul>




</li>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is about trying trying to figure out how much compatibility there is based on different factors.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme used for this game is date.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input is the keyboard and the mouse, there is some randomness to this in terms of how the ball moves in pong.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should be able to press the keys on the keyboard and be able to move the mouse, so that they can answer the questions. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The Player has to choose yes or no based on the question. If the player chooses yes for pong then they play a game of pong.
If the player wins then that is taken in account when calculating the compatibility.
If the player chooses yes for math then they answer math question. The number correct answer is taken in account when calculating the compatibility.
They can play again to get a better score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype is game states, there are a lot of game states in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player has control of what they like and don't like, and if they like something they get to do it.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting takes place in a restaurant where two people go on a date.
They try to find out what their compatibility is.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
When the number for compatibility is higer then the two people will like each other more.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are board and just want to play a quick game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game take on an average around 5 minute to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
If the player is trying to get a higher compatibility rate then they should like pong and math.
This is based on personal preferences.
</li>

The prototype assets were from the listed websites.
