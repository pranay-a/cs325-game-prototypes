<h2>Save the Earth</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is about the Earth avoiding the asteriod. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Asteroid heading toward Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input is the mouse; you have to move the mouse to control where the Earth is. 
Randomness in the game is where the asteroid bounces.
Genre is space action. 
Play style is using the mouse to avoid the asteriod.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should be able to move the mouse fast to avoid the asteriod.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move left or right with the mouse and has to try not to touch the asteriod that is bouncing around. As the player keeps on avoiding the asteriod the score is increased by one. 
If this was not the prototype then it would have levels and lives. As the levels increase, after getting to a certain score, there would be more astriods bouncing around. Then when the astriod hits the Earth then the player will lose a life. Also the player would be able to move in all the directions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype is evaluating moving the Earth around to avoid the asteroid.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player has control of the Earth and this is set in space. Also the way the asteriod moves is unique.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in space and there is an asteriod that is going in crazy directions and the scientists can't predict what the direction of the asteriod is so there only hope of saving the planet is to move it right before the asteriod hits it.
Only the player can save the planet at the right moment.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The scientists are unavailable to predict the direction because this asteriod have different gravity field unknown to man.
This makes the player not know where the asteriod will be.
</li>
